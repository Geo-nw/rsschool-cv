I have been working as an engineer at Institute of Physics of Kazan Federal University since 2016.
I am also a student of [UAI](https://neural-university.com/) and [RS School](https://community-z.com/events/js-rsschool-ge). I previously took HTML and CSS courses at [“Specialist”](http://en.specialist.ru/).
I have been independently studying Wordpress and basics of SEO. I have developed my [own website](http://diving-vsegda.ru/).
I do not have an experience in commercial software engineering.
I have management skills and executive experience in non-IT area. I am trying hard to acquire skills to work remotely.
My hobbies are scuba diving, traveling, cooking.
